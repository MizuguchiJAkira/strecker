## What we measure

Per-species **density estimates** (animals/km²) for a property over a
defined survey period, with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals and a
sufficient/recommend-survey/insufficient-data flag.

We do not measure damage dollars. The relationship between hog density
and parcel-scale crop loss is poorly characterized in the literature
(producer-survey recall bias, state-level extrapolations that break
down at parcel scale); reinsurers run their own damage models against
verified density inputs. We provide the verified density.

## Estimator: Random Encounter Model (REM)

Rowcliffe, Field, Turvey & Carbone 2008 (*Journal of Applied Ecology*):

```
D = (y/t) · π / (v · r · (2 + θ))
```

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| `D` | Density (animals / km²) | Output |
| `y/t` | Detections per camera-day | Computed from camera trap data |
| `v` | Mean daily travel distance (km/day) | Per-species, published |
| `r` | Camera detection radius (km) | Spec: 0.015 km (15 m) for medium IR |
| `θ` | Camera detection angle (radians) | Spec: 0.7 rad (~40°) for medium IR |

**Why REM, not capture-recapture or N-mixture?** REM does not require
individual identification, which is unreliable at population scale for
species without natural marks (feral hog, deer at distance, raccoon).
It also does not require closed-population assumptions, which are
violated by transient species at parcel scale.

### Per-species movement parameters

Hard-coded in `config/settings.py` (`SPECIES_MOVEMENT`):

| Species             | v (km/day) | sd  | Source                              |
|---------------------|-----------:|----:|-------------------------------------|
| Feral hog           | 6.0        | 2.5 | Kay et al. 2017; McClure et al. 2015 |
| White-tailed deer   | 1.5        | 0.8 | Webb et al. 2010                    |
| Axis deer           | 3.0        | 1.2 | Literature range (TX-specific scarce) |
| Coyote              | 10.0       | 4.0 | Andelt 1985                         |

For species without a published `v` (e.g. raccoon, opossum), we report
the raw detection rate (events per camera-day) as an unscaled index
and explicitly omit the density estimate. The recommendation flag
reads "insufficient data" with a method note explaining why.

## Confidence intervals

Bootstrap 95% via 1000 iterations:
- **Camera bootstrap**: resample cameras with replacement (the design's
  primary stochastic source per Rowcliffe 2012).
- **Movement-distance perturbation**: per-iteration `v_sample` ∼ N(v, sd),
  truncated to [0.5·v, 1.5·v]. Truncation prevents the upper CI tail
  from inflating ~10× under physically implausible v < 0.5·v_published
  values; the published `sd` captures inter-individual / inter-region
  variation, not within-survey uncertainty.

## Bias correction

Camera placement is non-random in operational deployments (feeders,
trails, water, crossings inflate detection rates by up to 9.7× per
Kolowski & Forrester 2017). We correct via inverse propensity weighting
on `placement_context`:

```
weighted_rate = sum_i (rate_i / P(placement_i | covariates_i))
              / sum_i (1 / P(placement_i | covariates_i))
```

Each camera carries a `placement_context` value from the user during
camera setup. Residual confounding is reported as a caveat in the
dashboard output.

(Implementation note: the bias module ships with the next release.
Tonight's dashboard reports unweighted rates with the placement caveat
surfaced explicitly.)

## Recommendation logic

Per species, per survey period:

| Condition                                                    | Flag                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `< 100` total camera-days OR `< 20` total events             | `insufficient_data`                |
| CI upper / CI lower ratio `> 1.5`                            | `recommend_supplementary_survey`   |
| Otherwise                                                    | `sufficient_for_decision`          |

Thresholds are tunable in `config/settings.py`:
`MIN_CAMERA_DAYS_FOR_DENSITY`, `MIN_DETECTIONS_FOR_DENSITY`,
`DENSITY_CI_RATIO_THRESHOLD`.

## What the actuary gets

For each species at each property/period, a JSON record:

```json
{
  "species_key":              "feral_hog",
  "common_name":              "Feral Hog",
  "density_animals_per_km2":  5.13,
  "density_ci_low":           1.29,
  "density_ci_high":          16.64,
  "n_cameras":                3,
  "total_camera_days":        174.0,
  "total_detections":         69,
  "recommendation":           "recommend_supplementary_survey",
  "caveats": [
    "Cameras at non-random placements (feeder, trail) violate REM's
     movement-independence assumption. Inverse propensity weighting
     (Kolowski & Forrester 2017) corrects for residual bias but does
     not eliminate it."
  ],
  "method_notes": [
    "Daily travel distance: v = 6.0 km/day (sd 2.5). Source: Kay et al. 2017."
  ]
}
```

Audit trail (camera-day granularity, individual detection timestamps,
SpeciesNet inference confidence per photo) is retained and available
on request.

## What we do not claim

- We do not estimate damage dollars.
- We do not estimate density for species without published movement
  parameters.
- We do not infer presence outside the camera's detection cone.
- We do not extrapolate beyond the surveyed property without explicit
  habitat-similarity tooling (separate product line).
