# Basal Informatics — Methodology

*One-page brief for ag lenders and loan-review committees. Intended audience:
Farm Credit System associations, regional agricultural banks, and the
portfolio-management / collateral-review teams that commission ecological
condition assessments on parcels they lend against.*

## Who submits the data

Landowners with active agricultural loans. Submission is either required
at loan renewal or incentivized through rate terms — the same
documentation pattern that already covers soil tests, yield records, and
irrigation logs. The landowner exports their own trail-cam SD cards and
uploads a single `.zip` through a Basal web form; the resulting Nature
Exposure Report is shared with their lender for collateral review.

Basal does not collect data from the landowner without their participation.
The lender commissions the report; the landowner supplies the raw photos;
Basal produces the methodology-backed output.

## What we measure

Pipeline outputs — **index + density + tier**, in that order of
primacy:

1. **Detection frequency** (events per camera-day): the raw relative
   abundance index, computed directly from independent-event counts.
   This is the pre-REM, minimum-assumption quantity. Two parcels
   surveyed with identical camera deployments can be compared on this
   number alone without invoking any movement-distance assumption.
2. **Density estimate** (animals/km²): the REM-scaled per-area
   population derived from the detection rate using per-species daily
   travel distance. Reported with a bootstrap 95% confidence interval.
3. **Tier** (Low / Moderate / Elevated / Severe, feral hog only v1):
   the binary-decision-grade classification per Mayer & Brisbin 2009
   hog-density bins. Drives the loan-review committee's
   go / condition / no-go / survey-required decision path.

Alongside these we also publish an **Exposure Score** (0–100,
piecewise-linear anchored on the tier cutoffs) for visual legibility
on a single gauge, and a **modeled annual crop-damage projection** as
supplementary context — but those are derivations, not the primary
outputs.

Damage dollars are NOT a pipeline output. The relationship between hog
density and parcel-scale crop loss is poorly characterized in the
literature (producer-survey recall bias, state-level extrapolations
that break down at parcel scale). We produce the density + rate + tier
with methodology-defensible confidence intervals; the dollar-scaling
is attached separately under a `supplementary_projection` object in
the JSON API, with its own disclaimer. A loan committee with an
internal damage model should consume the pipeline outputs directly
and ignore our dollar block; committees without an internal model can
use our dollar figure as a convenience projection, clearly labeled.

## Estimator: Random Encounter Model (REM)

Rowcliffe, Field, Turvey & Carbone 2008 (*Journal of Applied Ecology*):

```
D = (y/t) · π / (v · r · (2 + θ))
```

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| `D` | Density (animals / km²) | Output |
| `y/t` | Detections per camera-day | Computed from camera trap data |
| `v` | Mean daily travel distance (km/day) | Per-species, published |
| `r` | Camera detection radius (km) | Spec: 0.015 km (15 m) for medium IR |
| `θ` | Camera detection angle (radians) | Spec: 0.7 rad (~40°) for medium IR |

**Why REM, not capture-recapture or N-mixture?** REM does not require
individual identification, which is unreliable at population scale for
species without natural marks (feral hog, deer at distance, raccoon).
It also does not require closed-population assumptions, which are
violated by transient species at parcel scale.

### Per-species movement parameters

Hard-coded in `config/settings.py` (`SPECIES_MOVEMENT`):

| Species             | v (km/day) | sd  | Source                              |
|---------------------|-----------:|----:|-------------------------------------|
| Feral hog           | 6.0        | 2.5 | Kay et al. 2017; McClure et al. 2015 |
| White-tailed deer   | 1.5        | 0.8 | Webb et al. 2010                    |
| Axis deer           | 3.0        | 1.2 | Literature range (TX-specific scarce) |
| Coyote              | 10.0       | 4.0 | Andelt 1985                         |

For species without a published `v` (e.g. raccoon, opossum), we report
the raw detection rate (events per camera-day) as an unscaled index
and explicitly omit the density estimate. The recommendation flag
reads "insufficient data" with a method note explaining why.

## Confidence intervals

Bootstrap 95% via 1000 iterations:
- **Camera bootstrap**: resample cameras with replacement (the design's
  primary stochastic source per Rowcliffe 2012).
- **Movement-distance perturbation**: per-iteration `v_sample` ∼ N(v, sd),
  truncated to [0.5·v, 1.5·v]. Truncation prevents the upper CI tail
  from inflating ~10× under physically implausible v < 0.5·v_published
  values; the published `sd` captures inter-individual / inter-region
  variation, not within-survey uncertainty.

## Bias correction

Camera placement is non-random in operational deployments (feeders,
trails, water, crossings inflate detection rates by up to 9.7× per
Kolowski & Forrester 2017). We correct via inverse propensity weighting
on `placement_context`:

```
weighted_rate = sum_i (rate_i / P(placement_i | covariates_i))
              / sum_i (1 / P(placement_i | covariates_i))
```

Each camera carries a `placement_context` value from the user during
camera setup. Residual confounding is reported as a caveat in the
dashboard output.

(Implementation note: the bias module ships with the next release.
Tonight's dashboard reports unweighted rates with the placement caveat
surfaced explicitly.)

## Recommendation logic

Per species, per survey period:

| Condition                                                    | Flag                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `< 100` total camera-days OR `< 20` total events             | `insufficient_data`                |
| CI upper / CI lower ratio `> 1.5`                            | `recommend_supplementary_survey`   |
| Otherwise                                                    | `sufficient_for_decision`          |

Thresholds are tunable in `config/settings.py`:
`MIN_CAMERA_DAYS_FOR_DENSITY`, `MIN_DETECTIONS_FOR_DENSITY`,
`DENSITY_CI_RATIO_THRESHOLD`.

## What the loan-review committee gets

For each species on each parcel for each survey period, both the
lender dashboard (`/lender/<slug>/parcel/<id>`) and the JSON API
(`/lender/api/<slug>/parcel/<id>/exposure`) return a structured
record suitable for import into the lender's internal portfolio-
management system:

The record shape explicitly separates pipeline outputs from
supplementary modeled projections, so downstream importers cannot
accidentally treat the damage dollar figure as a pipeline output:

    "crop_modifier":             1.30,
    "per_hog_annual_usd":        405,
    "disclaimer": "Not a pipeline output. Derived from third-party loss
                   data (Anderson et al. 2016 per-hog damage figures

                   for loan-review committees that have not yet built
                   their own damage model; a committee with an internal
                   model should consume the pipeline outputs above
                   instead."
  }
}
```

The parallel under `stats` also includes `n_cameras`, `total_camera_days`, and `total_detections` at the property-level summary.

Audit trail is retained at **camera-day granularity**: individual
detection timestamps, SpeciesNet inference confidence per photo, and
the raw ZIP the landowner submitted. Available for any downstream
review the lender or its auditor runs.

## Pricing

- **Per parcel-verification:** $1,500 per report. One-time per survey window.
- **Portfolio unlimited:** $5,000 / month. Unlimited parcels in the lender's portfolio.

The alternative is a ~$40,000 independent field-biologist survey that's
point-in-time and goes stale inside six months. Basal is ~25× cheaper
at the per-parcel tier and continuously refreshable rather than stale.

## What we do not claim

- We do not estimate damage dollars.
- We do not estimate density for species without published movement
  parameters.
- We do not infer presence outside the camera's detection cone.
- We do not extrapolate beyond the surveyed property without explicit
  habitat-similarity tooling (separate product line).
