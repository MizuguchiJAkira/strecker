"""Methodology appendix — bound into every parcel report.

A loan-review committee or external reviewer flips here to confirm the
finding is defensible. The page mirrors docs/METHODOLOGY.md but
compressed for a two-page PDF spread:

  Page 1 — What we measure, REM density, placement-bias correction
  Page 2 — Confidence intervals, recommendation logic, limitations,
