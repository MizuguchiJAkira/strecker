"""Invasive species damage quantification.

DCF model converting IPW-corrected detection frequencies into
estimated annual crop and property damage using USDA-APHIS base
rates, scaled on a logistic curve and calibrated by ecoregion.

The logistic scaling is critical: damage doesn't increase linearly
with hog density, it saturates. At low densities, animals avoid
each other and damage is sporadic. At high densities, the landscape
is already heavily impacted and marginal damage per animal decreases.

Confidence intervals widen with lower data confidence grades — the
report must be honest about uncertainty.

Caveat from Broadley et al. 2020: density-dependent movement means
cameras can underestimate population declines by up to 30%. Detection
frequency is a relative activity index, not an absolute population
measure.
