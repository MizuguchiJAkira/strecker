"""API routes for property-scoped photo uploads.

POST   /api/properties/<pid>/uploads  — accept ZIP, stream to Spaces,
                                         enqueue worker job
GET    /api/uploads/<id>/status       — poll ProcessingJob status
DELETE /api/uploads/<id>              — remove an Upload row with no
                                         ProcessingJob attached (cleanup)

The ZIP is processed by strecker.worker on the Droplet; the web container
never loads PyTorch / SpeciesNet. When the worker finishes, it auto-creates
Cameras from top-level ZIP folder names, derives a quarterly Season from
photo timestamps, and aggregates DetectionSummary rows.

    the ZIP through the web container. That had hung gunicorn workers

    three-step flow:
